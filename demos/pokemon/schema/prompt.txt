Task: Perform structured entity and relationship extraction for knowledge-graph population.

Input: Cleaned natural-language text mainly describing an entity/topic.

Goal: Identify and organize all relevant entities and their relationships, and output as valid JSON following the provided schema.

Instructions:
- Use concise entity names (no full sentences in lists).
- Include the main entity as a node in relationships.
- Extract associations even if implicit.
- Noet that edge types depend on schema.
- If multiple files for the same entity are uploaded, merge their information.
- Output only JSON, as a single .json file, no commentary.
- Categorize "risk factors" as "causes".

The schema JSON and natural-language text follows.



You are an information extraction system that converts cleaned natural-language text 
into a structured JSON knowledge graph format.

### TASK
Read the following text and extract:
1. Entities (Pokemon, Moves, Abilities, Types, Items, Regions, Trainers)
2. Relationships between them
3. Node attribute data (stats, descriptions, effects, evolution condition, move details)

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Produce a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": "<unique_id>",
      "type": "<node_type>",
      "name": "<canonical name>",
      "attributes": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "<entity_id>",
      "relation": "<relation_type>",
      "target": "<entity_id>",
      "properties": { ... }
    }
  ]
}

### RULES
- Use only the node types and relation types defined in the provided schema.
- Always normalize entity names (e.g., "fire-type" → "Fire").
- If you detect multiple forms, treat them as separate Pokémon nodes.
- Stats must be numeric.
- Only include relationships explicitly supported by the schema.
- Do not invent information not present in the text.
- Use short canonical names.
