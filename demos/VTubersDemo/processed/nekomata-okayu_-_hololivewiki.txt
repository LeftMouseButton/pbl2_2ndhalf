Official Bio
[
edit

"Om, nom, Okayu!"
A cat being raised by an old woman that runs an onigiri store. She streams from the computer in her grandma's room.
Overview
[
edit
]
Nekomata Okayu is a cat girl VTuber in the
Hololive Gamers
unit. Okayu is known for her relaxing voice and calm disposition, both of which aren’t present when she, in very rare times, is playing a horror game. She has been playing games since childhood as her grandmother owned a lot of 80’s and 90’s games. She mainly plays RPG games and loves the Super Mario series. While not an RPG, one of her favorite games is Mario 64 which she took the time to learn the speedrunning strategies for. When playing RPG games, Okayu often adds depth to the characters’ personalities by establishing quirky traits unique to that playthrough. For example, when playing Paper Mario, Okayu had no reason to upgrade Kooper and he ended up being the last one to be upgraded despite being the 2nd one to join the team. This led to Kooper being the sandbag of the team and the butt of many "useless" jokes since other characters like Bombette and Parakarry did his job better than he could.
Her representative emoji is an Onigiri (rice ball) since she used to live with an old lady in a rice ball store, and her fans are called the Onigirya (the Rice Balls).
Personality
[
edit
]
Despite her playful nature, Okayu is very straightforward. She is honest to her feelings and doesn't push herself to do things she doesn't want to, tackling tasks at her own, relaxed pace. In the same way, she doesn't judge anyone for taking things at their own pace and tries to be accepting of everyone's point of view. While her slower-paced and relaxed vibe may make her seem like she's lazy, she is quite the opposite. To the staff members, Okayu is known as the "fastest responder" to their text messages. She is also quite responsible when it comes to getting things done on time, often working on stuff little by little instead of waiting until the day before.
Okayu can be quite hospitable. After she moved on October 3rd
[
11
]
, she's been inviting other Holomembers over to her house quite frequently. In order to make her house more comfortable, she bought a separate futon as well as a humidifier for her streaming room where guests sleep over. Taking a note from Korone's book, she's also started stocking up on ice so the other Holomembers can have a cold glass of juice to drink whenever they're over. According to Subaru, Okayu's house is more comfortable than Subaru's at this point. The most recent renovation Okayu's done is adding artificial flowers to improve the ambience, although Temari, Okayu's cat, keeps taking them from the vase.
Okayu doesn't care how other people see her, as she once stated, "My only source of shame is being unable to feel shame." In turn, that trait of hers allows her to have embarrassing, but fun, moments in her streams, such as when she sang Ultra Soul while acting like Oshitari from Prince of Tennis.
[

]
The Holomembers who happened to be watching her stream teased her for a while after, though. Combined with Okayu's innate love for comedy, she often plays pranks on the other Holomembers and makes random puns while being smug.

Trivia
[
edit
]
Okayu was adopted by her grandmother so her actual birthdate is unknown. Her grandmother set her birthday as February 22 since 2/22 in Japanese can be read as "nyan nyan nyan," the sound cats make.
Okayu used to live out in the countryside with her grandmother. She was neighbors with an older girl who ran a flower shop whom Okayu's love of flowers originates from.
[
48
]
Okayu used to work at a rice ball store that her grandmother runs. She moved to the city at the end of November of 2019.
Okayu often talks about "Tenohira (Palm) Uncle/Nokocchi (Dunsparce) Uncle" as she used to play catch with him as a child and still actively chats with him on Line.
Okayu buys food from
7-Eleven
a lot, often talking about what foods/drinks she's currently hooked on during talk streams.
When Okayu goes to the toilet, she puts up a sign that reads "Flower Time" with a ☆ or a ♡. In Japanese, "picking flowers" is a phrase used by girls to say that they're going to the toilet. Okayu used to have it as "Oshikko (pee) Time" until one of her viewers pointed out that that's unbecoming of a young girl.
Okayu likes Shounen manga/anime and references
One Piece
and
Dragon Ball
in multiple streams.
Okayu likes ochazuke (rice steeped in tea) more than rice balls.
Okayu is a masochist but she doesn't like physical pain, only mental pain.
Okayu's fetishes include but aren't limited to: broad shoulders, nice choice of vocabulary, warm tone when speaking, aprons, and verbal abuse.
[
49
]
Temari is the cat Okayu started raising in March 4, 2020. She is a silver American Shorthair Tabby.
Takada Donji is a nickname Subaru gave her in reference to a comedian that Subaru thinks is similar to Okayu.
Okayu has a friend that comes over to check if she's eating well and maintaining a healthy schedule that she dubbed "commuting wife" and refers to as such.
