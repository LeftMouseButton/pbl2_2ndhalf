Official Bio
[
edit

"'Ello! Fingers! Give me your fingers!"
A dog from a bakery in the city. She likes to play games during her free time while watchdogging.
Overview
[
edit
]
Inugami Korone
is a dog girl VTuber in the
Hololive Gamers
sub-unit. She is 94 dog years old. She works at a bakery, thus the bread and pastry theming around her.
Korone is known for her endurance streams where she streams the same game for very long time, usually 5-12 hours.
Korone loves to play
Kusoge
or
Bakage
. She finds both kinds of games very endearing and will laugh at them instead of getting frustrated at the bad parts.
She is very close friends with
Nekomata Okayu
even before joining Hololive and the pair is often referred to as "Okakoro".
Korone doesn't tend to follow "trends" or what is popular. When everyone else was playing Animal Crossing for the Switch as soon as it came out, Korone decided to play a
Gegege no Kitaro SNES game.
Some Japanese fans have compared Korone to the Japanese TV station TV Tokyo, that will air anime or other programs instead of talking about important current events like other channels at the same time are doing.
She has said she did not audition for Hololive, but got in due to being referred by Okayu
[
9
]
, although in a now private HoloRadio episode, Fubuki says she saw Okayu and Korone at an arcade and decided to ask them to join.
[
10
]
Her representative emote is a croissant, because she works at a bakery.
Personality
[
edit
]
Korone has a very cheerful and energetic personality, she seems very outgoing but despite this she is sometimes shy in collabs with many people. Although she has slowly become more open to talking with people she is not close friends with over the years.
She can be described as a bit "eccentric" or doing things at her own pace, she would like to do a stream about various torture methods
[
11
]
, will sometimes turn her attempt at ending a stream into talking with the viewers, she does not have set schedule and will end streams when she has had enough instead of streaming for a set amount of time. She has a strong conscience, as she felt bad when she finished her attempt at
"Dragon's Lair"
as she felt she didn't do it fairly. She had 30 lives instead of the default 5, which to her felt like cheating. Korone later uploaded a video of her finishing the game with the base 5 lives available.
[
12
]
She tends to act very playful by making various noises relating to her in-game actions, adding various props on screen (such as a coffee mug with a pepper in it) or messing with her model, such as making copies of it or putting it upside down on the screen.
She tends to find all manner of weird looking things "cute" and will easily get very emotional if the game she is playing deals with themes of death of family members, or parting with friends / partners; In her Monster Rancher stream she got very sad when she had to freeze her monster due to old age (that she had at the start of the game called ugly but gotten very attached to), as well as in the ending to the game Klonoa, where it is revealed the main character is not actually part of the game's world and is forced to leave his friend behind and return to his own world.

Alice in Wonderland themed costume reveal
Korone and fingers
[
edit
]
Korone's drawing of her viewers
One of Korone's greetings/catchphrases is "Yubi Yubi" (literally: Finger finger). Early on in her career, Korone explained she will take the viewers fingers at the start of the stream, place them in ice water for safe keeping for the duration of it, and gives them back when it is over, though this has since become obsolete.
On her debut stream with the other Gamers she came up with the idea of taking the viewers fingers and Mio asked if the fingers are a hostage, which Korone liked. May also originate from before her debut on Youtube, her fingers were getting tired from responding to tweets and she wished she had 100 of them.
Korone's stream ending used to be a short gag she has setup using clip art and a caricature of the viewers she has drawn receiving their finger back, but something happens causing the finger to turn blue and thus unrecoverable. This has been largely replaced by a more general "Ending Making Time" segment where something happens to the viewers, often them exploding.
Traffic Lights
[
edit
]
Viewers may sometimes see traffic lights on Korone's stream. This indicates the current flow of the chat as perceived by Korone. They are just for fun and shouldn't be taken seriously as it is just another aspect of Korone's playfulness. The traffic lights started on her
Assassins Creed Valhalla stream
.
Traffic Lights as sometimes seen on Korone's stream

Red: Pestering phase

is a sesame seed. Korone's chat was so small she thought they looked like sesame seeds (goma) and because they were so demanding, she dubbed them kings. Goma kings.

Trivia
[
edit
]
Korone fans like to donate 563 yens because it spells out her nickname: 5 (Ko) 6 (Ro) 3 (San).
During her introduction stream her height was mistakenly listed as 156 meters (~512 ft).
Korone's dog breed is a
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
.
[
45
]
She saw a Tool Assisted Speedrun (TAS) of Castlevania 4 on Youtube and after playing the game for multiple hours wondered how "Tas-kun" could beat the game in such a short time.
Shares the same Illustrator with the following VTubers:
Civia
of
Hololive China 1st Generation
,
Ayano Date
, "Fukahire Sisters" (
Makino Monaka
,
Utakata Shirabe
,
Satou Mewmew
,
Aosaki Rozu
) of
Avatar 2.0 Project
,
Shellin Burgundy
of Nijisanji, and
Kouichi
of VirtuaReal.
Korone has a sizable English speaking fan-base and she will often try to speak in English on stream to interact with them. This has lead to creation of multiple "memes" around her due to her pronunciation such as when she tried to pronounce the name "Exposito", but it it sounded like X Potato, as well as in her frequent "Japanese lessons" at the end of her streams, when she tried to explain "as you wish" but it sounded like "as you fish". Korone has mentioned she is actively studying English with the help of a teacher.
[
46
]
As a tradition she used to yell "Hey Guys!" near the end of her streams when she will talk to her English speaking fans. It started as a tradition in her Siren stream where she mentioned she enjoys how saying it will get a response from all her overseas fans. On the same stream she also started her "Japanese study time" section of her streams, where she will teach her viewers a Japanese word or phrase, though these have largely stopped.

.
After a capture card failure, Korone unveiled
Dark Side Korone
, better known as enorok, to her viewers. enoroK has a personality that is the opposite of the usual Korone and has an inverted color spectrum appearance. She encouraged viewers to go to bed early and scolded Korone for keeping her viewers up so late with long streams lasting 10 - 12 hours. She also went on to return the "Yubi's" of her viewers in contrast to Korone who takes them but did not like being referred to as kind for doing so.
[
49
]
She does not like bacon.
[
50
]
Nyanpyou
[
edit
]
A white cat-like creature holding a sword that was sometimes seen jumping somewhere at the start of Korone's stream. Although she sometimes very rarely still references this character, it has long since vanished from regular use. On Dec 30, 2019 Korone played the Playstation 2 game "Pyū to Fuku! Jaguar: Ashita no Jump"
[
51
]
which contained a game within a game featuring Nyanpyou called "Nyanpyou the flute Meister" (ニャンピョウのフエマイスター).
Korone took an extreme liking to this and played it for 7 hours, coming back next day to complete the game and play it for close to 12 hours. She would return to the game two more times for a combined 11 hours to get 100% completion and even asked for viewers to submit their drawings of Nyanpyou that she showcased on stream.
Hosoinu and Futoinu
[
edit
]
Hosoinu (Right) and Futoinu (Left)
Two dogs sometimes seen as props on Korone's stream, or as emotes on her channel.
Hosoinu is a portmanteau of
hosoi
(thin) and
inu
(dog) and Futoinu is a portmanteau of
futo
(fat) and
inu
(dog)
Futoinu is based on her signature and Hosoinu is a failed attempt at the same drawing. Korone thought it would be funny to make them emotes, so she did. They were not used much until
Ordan
,
Tokino Sora
's illustrator, started using them in her chat and it caught on. Later Korone would get fully fleshed out designs of the dogs and they've become a mainstay in her chat and streams.
The design is clearly based on Snoopy as Korone is a big fan of it. Only Hosoinu was fleshed out at first and Futoinu followed a while later only because people felt bad for it being left out.
