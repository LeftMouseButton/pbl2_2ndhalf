Introduction Video

Official Bio
[
edit

"Good foxy day to you! I'm Shirakami Fubuki!"
White-haired animal-eared otaku fox. She loves talking with people and will be happy if you give her the time of day. She aims to become a top otaku idol while enjoying each and every day.
Overview
[
edit
]
Shirakami Fubuki
(白上フブキ) born October 5 is a fox girl in
Hololive 1st Generation
and is the leader of
hololive GAMERS
.
She is most known for her short-skit videos posted on Twitter and Youtube. Having an exposure to western and eastern culture memes, she demonstrates it to her audience in some shape or form. She is dubbed as the "Queen of Memes", among other related titles that the fans have given her.
She plays a variety of games, and often loves to try out any kind of games in any genres. Despite saying that she doesn't like horror games, she seems to enjoy streaming and playing them. When she was asked about her skills, she admitted that she had terrible aim in FPS games.
She is also known to be a poor driver, having a tendency to mess around with her colleagues to get a laugh out of them as well.
She is known to be a whale (high spender) in gacha games and any other games with similar aspects, and has shown streaming her rolls in mobile games like
FGO
and
Twisted Wonderland.
In Japanese, the onomatopoeia for a fox’s bark is “kon-kon.” which sounds like "corn". As a result, corn has become Fubuki’s representative emoji.
Personality
[
edit
]
Shirakami Fubuki
debuted with a personality showing off a timid, shy girl that fumbles over her words often, often hiding off the screen and quickly running away when doing embarrassing things. She enjoys talking with people and would enjoy it if you paid attention to her.
Throughout the years, she has gained experience, confidence, the stamina to talk a lot (as demonstrated by her MC-ing the 6 hour long HoloComi event and having sang and MC'd in Non-Stop Story for the majority of the concert), and the skill to befriend anyone she meets. She is close to her colleagues and tries to help them in any way she can, directly or indirectly, even at the cost of her own self. She shouldered the pillar of the family around the start of Hololive and has kept it up until recently where she has started relying on her own colleagues too.
Fubuki
, alongside
Hololive 1st Generation
Natsuiro Matsuri
, has been pushing towards easing the interactions with the sibling-branch Holostars and her fellow Hololive talents. She has collaborated and interacted with the Holostars talents a number of times. Added to this, she often collaborates and messes with Holostar Talent
Yukoku Roberu
as of recent events, such as bringing bombs to the Robel's Bar, or turning him into a bacon during his sleep. She also has a group name with Holostar Talent
Aragami Oga
called
FOXDEMON
and has a dynamic of being the lady (Fubuki) of the Shirakami House and its maid (Oga); they often collab and do talk/question streams, or competition streams.
She is known to be a large spender on gachas in mobile games and has streamed her characters draws before. Some of the viewers get scared with the shockingly high amount of money that she puts into these games. She feels emotional sometimes when she feels impatient or desperate. Examples of this in Animal Crossing are when her Turnip Stocks crash, or when neighbors leave. She also shows her emotions openly when she goes on a 50 draw spree in her mobile games and getting nothing out of it, or her indecisive decisions in shooters leaving her vulnerable. Despite these things happening, she takes them in stride and plays it out as part of her gag.
She is known to be friends with some indie and other major company/group VTubers and has collaborated with many of them before. They all have a generally good opinion of her, and most of her colleagues sees her as an important figure as well as a good friend. The 1
st
generation
Natsuiro Matsuri
has commented in a twitcast that
Fubuki
is the pillar to Hololive and kept it steady. She is held highly in regards to her reputation and character, and she shoulders the responsibility and weight of people that rely on her.
Fubuki
can get easily agitated when you call her a cat due to the frequency of people (newbies and fans alike) often mistaking her for a cat. The joke is either done for fun, or purely by accident and she will blurt out
"Neko Janai! Kitsune Jai!(I'm not a cat! I'm a fox!)"
.
She is easily embarrassed by certain topics, as evident by some of her member-only streams, chatting streams, or collaboration interactions. Examples of this are Natsuiro Matsuri and Shiranui Flare teasing and poking at her among others. She has a tendency of feeling wary or anxious when she makes jokes/pranks behind someone's back or if someone isn't in the presence of her pranks, but she enjoys doing it anyways.

Fans

Shirakami Fubuki's
fans and members are called the same name,
Su-Corns (すこん部) .
Members are defined by the growth starting as a corn and having Kurokami as an icon past a certain month in. She thanks new members by saying "Thank you for membership!" and rarely reads out Superchats unless the message piques her interest. In certain streams if she's feeling happier than usual, she ends it in a different way where she calls out every new membership and reads all Superchats before ending it with a good-night/good-bye message.
The Su-corns did not have their own design since Fubuki's debut and were always depicted as men with corn cobs as their heads. Despite their similarities, Su-corns and Oruyanke are not the same mascot. The two versions of the Su-corn mascot designed are for her Japanese fanbase and her Overseas fanbase. The Japanese fanbase version dons a sky-blue scarf whilst the Overseas fanbase version, dubbed Friend, dons a navy blue ribbon

. "Aya" stands for
Ayame,
"Fubu" stands for
Fubuki,
"Mi" stands for
Mio
, and "Ko" stands for
Miko
. The concert is a traditional Japan inspired concert that recreates the atmosphere of the
Hololive Alternative
web manga:
Yamato Phantasia.
In 2021, Fubuki started playing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond. Her intention was to play the game with a team consisting only of
Shiny
Pokémon
(
色違い
in Japanese). The odds of finding a Shiny Pokémon are 1 in 4096, which means making a full team of them would require a lot of time and luck.
Before streaming the game, she reset her save until she had Shiny Chimchar for her starter Pokémon.
During her first stream, she decided to also get a Shiny Shinx, which she did capture the same week while playing off-stream.
For her third Pokémon, she decided to capture Magikarp. This, which required a lot of fishing, proved to be far more challenging:
The search for the golden Shiny Magikarp took her 27 days, 26 streams of between 2 and 7 hours, more than 10,000 fishing attempts and almost 222 hours of in-game time (including time played off-stream).
[
67
]
The phrase she said every time a regular Magikarp appeared, "It's red~" (
赤いなぁ～
), became a meme on its own, with other Hololive members commenting how Fubuki always took her Switch to the studio and kept trying to catch a golden Magikarp even during their recording breaks, saying "It's red~" every time she fished a regular red Magikarp.

]
[

]
During her streams, other Hololive members either collaborated with her doing her own hunt for rare, ShinyPokémon, or commented on her chat to cheer her on. On day 18,
Kazama Iroha
showed up on chat, offering her golden hair to make the Pokémon golden, or to use as a fishing line.
[
71
]
Due to this, Fubuki decided to name her future golden Magikarp "King Kazama".
[
72
]
On day 23, one of her two Pokémon got Pokérus, a stat-enhancing "illness" that a Pokémon has a 3 in 65536 chance of acquiring after a battle.
[
73
]
She caught the golden Shiny Magikarp on December 24.
[
74
]
. Not even two hours later, she got verified on Twitter.
[
54
]
This prompted her to tweet "Golden Magikarp and verification mark, they both came today! Santa is real after all!".
[
75
]
Her fourth Shiny Pokémon was a Clefairy, which
Mio
gave to her as a gift.
[
76
]
After capturing the Shiny Magikarp and advancing through the game, Fubuki decided to get a Shiny Gastly. She caught one on the 3rd day.

Kurokami
[
edit
]
Kurokami
is Fubuki's alter persona, appeared at some point in February of 2019. She formally made her debut in September 07
th
2019.
[
78
]
She has a more aggressive and harsh nature in contrast to the shy and calm Fubuki everyone knows, often not having any tact, coming off verbally strong to people, pushes her work to other people and absolutely hates doing embarrassing things.
Kurokami
collabed with Matsuri's alter persona named
Natsuiro Matsuhiko
in December 04
th
2019
[
79
]
playing the game called Super Bunny Man.
After a collab stream with
OKFAMS
over at
Ookami Mio's
house, Fubuki stated in her stream she couldn't stream so on the next day Kurokami took over for a single stream of her playing an RPG maker game.
[
80
]
She also recently did an independent stream, doing Missing Children and promptly being frustrated by the game throughout the stream.

is known to hold many forms and appearances, other than being simply "Fubuki" and "Kurokami", she has shown to pretend to be a cat once during a stream, as well as a Yukkuri-head, a shark, an eel, a fish, a pigeon and a crab (karkanos from ARK).
Many fanarts and materials of these formations exists, and most has made more than one appearance, with Yukkuri and Shark being the most often appearance thus far. Many people makes furniture and objects out of her, like how there's a Air Humidifier filled with Asacoco liquid that has a shape and appearance of Fubuki, and so forth.
