"It's your shooting star, your diamond in the rough, idol VTuber Hoshimachi Suisei!"
A forever18 VTuber who deeply loves singing and idols.
Her dream is to one day hold a live concert in Tokyo Budokan.
Overview
[
edit
]
Hoshimachi Suisei
(星街すいせい) born on March 22 is a cheerful shining Idol and VTuber from
Hololive 0th Generation
. She is a forever 18, multitalented girl who deeply loves singing and idols, with the dream of one day holding a live concert in Tokyo Budokan. She started out as an independent VTuber and later joined Inonaka Music, a music label under Hololive, before moving officially to Hololive main branch.
Her name "Suisei" translates to "Comet" in English, while her last name "Hoshimachi" translates to "City of stars" in English ,and as such is usually referred to as the comet idol. She is well known for her amazing skills in Tetris, as she is often being called out as the best among VTubers, as well as her psychopathic personality, as shown when she sometimes acts ruthless to others while still giving off a cheerful attitude.
Her representative emote is a comet.
Personality
[
edit
]
Hoshimachi Suisei
debutted with a modest and earnest personality to do the best in everything she did. She is always cheerful and energetic, rarely showing genuine sadness in streams, and her viewers used to view her as a pure person. She is also hardworking, with her continuing to do VTuber activities even after a year with barely any growth and having her determination to join Hololive even after her first application failed. However, during a stream collaboration with various Hololive members, she was shown to have a remorseless and sociopathic personality while still giving off a carefree attitude when she was killing and hunting out people. Over time, people started to refer to this side of her as
"Psychopath Suisei"
or
"Suicopath"
, with her denying it as a side of her.
She is particularly sensitive to the topic of chest size as seen in various occasions, and usually threatens her viewers whenever the topic is brought up in the live comments section. On one occasion in a stream with fellow member
Shirogane Noel
, she shared how when she met with Noel for the first time, she was taken aback by her size.
She is a large spender on gacha games, especially the gacha game "Ensemble Stars". In a stream with Nijisanji VTuber and friend
Inui Toko
, she spent an absurd amount of money that shocked both her viewers and Toko, who was also a huge gacha spender on the game. In a quiz stream about gacha games, she was agitated when fellow member
Oozora Subaru
commented how gacha games were just a waste of money.
She usually cares greatly for those close to her, especially her VTuber friends. She has a close relationship with not only
Amane Kanata
, a fellow member, but also people outside of Hololive, including but not limited to
Inui Toko, Lupinus Knightely, Kuon Ran
and her real older sister nicknamed
Anemachi
.

Trivia
[
edit
]
Kuon Ran (久遠 藍)
[
89
]
and
Lupinus Knightley (ルピナス・ナイトリー)
[
90
]
are indie VTubers who are close friends with Suisei, going back to when Suisei was still independent. They helped design Suisei's unique microphone for 3D streams, with Lupinus designing it and Ran turning it into a 3D model.
She is usually seen to be a multi-talented idol due to the huge number of skills she has. She can draw (her original design and outfits for it were drawn by her), edit videos and make her own thumbnails, sing, cook, and play various games well
(Tetris, Muse Dash etc)
.
She never took singing lessons, instead practiced singing by going for karaoke sessions alone.
She used to drink orange juice on stream but stopped drinking it as it irritated her throat easily, so she recently switched to apple juice instead. Usually has a picture of her drink during streams and position it as if her character was sipping from it when she takes a break to drink.
Favorite things to eat are
spicy, sour or salty food, yakiniku and fish eyeballs
. Dislikes eating
bitter or sweet food, vegetables, and sushi(the combination of raw fish and vinegar rice)
.
Favorite games are
Ensemble Stars, Cinderella Girls
and
Tetris
.
Favorite game characters are
Sakuma Ritsu (Ensemble Stars), Takagaki Kaede (Idol Master)
and
Hisakawa Hayate (Idol Master)
.
Hate all kinds of bugs.
The crown that sits on top of her beret is made up of 2 separate crowns, which is thus sometimes referred to as the "
Triple Crown
".
She doesn't know how to whistle properly, and as such has been a joke among her viewers since the start of her VTuber career.
Doesn't like singing "
Shiny Smily Story
" as she can't hit the high notes well.
She has a poor sense of direction, easily getting lost even when using Google Maps to find her way.
Once during a
Marika (Mario Kart)
stream, Suisei was brutally beaten and lost badly. As a result, she can't accept marika anymore and whenever it is brought up, she acts confused like a disorder on her mind similar to remembering a psychologically hurting event.
AYT
is something Suisei made up when she designed her phone case merch. It means
(A)idoru (Y)ou(T)uber
. Aidoru translates to "Idol" in English. Some fans were confused why she didn't name it AVT, which is Aidoru VirtualTuber. Suisei then clarified that it was because it would be an abbreviation of AV, which doesn't look good. She also admitted that "Idol" would have been better instead of "Aidoru", but had forgotten to use it that way, hence why it isn't IYT either. However, there is also a second definition of it which Suisei says everyone mistook it for. It actually means
(A)nta no Kane de (Y)akiniku (T)abe ni iku
, which translates to
"I'm gonna eat Yakiniku using your money"
.
Prior to Hololive, she was part of a VTuber group called
"S:gnal"
.
Sakanoue Yosuke
[
91
]
is a regular guitarist on Suisei's weekly radio program. Music Space, and often plays the songs being sung. In the initial weeks of the radio program he didn't have a model, but after a while received a panda themed live 2D model.
Suisei is a member of
"karASHi"
, a group comprising of
Akai Haato, Shiranui Flare
and
Hoshimachi Suisei
. The first letter of their last names make up
ASH
, with
(A)
kai,
(S)
hiranui, and
(H)
oshimachi. Over time, the group name evolved from just "ASH" to "karASHi". Coincidentally, "karashi" is also formed by the second syllables of their last names (a
KA
i, shi
RA
nui, and ho
SHI
machi).
Suisei is part of
"Hoshi no Kanata" (星の彼方)
, a duo group comprising of

Iroha was so happy to be called by Suisei, she ended up delaying starting her own stream just to be able to continue talking with Suisei.
[
98
]
For the first six years of her career, Suisei's intro was "...
your diamond in the rough!
Idol VTuber
Hoshimachi Suisei!...
". She would later change it to be: ...
your diamond in the rough!
Virtual idol
Hoshimachi Suisei!...
". The change was due to the shift in her activities after those six years, going from primary Youtube and streaming to more IRL events and music with some streaming in between.
[
99
]
Similarly, her dream for the first six years of her career was to perform at the
Nippon Budokan
. Following
her first concert there in 2025
, her new dream became to perform at the
Tokyo Dome
.
Tetris Master / Hololive Tetris Queen
[
edit
]
She is shown to have remarkable skill at tetris when she beat fellow Hololive member
Akai Haato
, who was also a very strong player. While not at professional level, Suisei is shown to be extremely good at the game and seen as the best tetris player among VTubers, sometimes ending games against other VTubers in less than 20 seconds. In a rematch against Haato, Suisei crushed her with a final score of 57-6. Her skill is further shown to be high when she held off against the world's #2 player for 5 minutes during one of her Tetris 99 streams.
Psychopath
[
edit
]
Suisei is sometimes seen as a psychopath by her fans and other VTubers, occasionally acting ruthless when playing games like
"Tetris"
and
"Project Winter"
. During these occasions, she has been shown to kill off or K.O. her opponents without remorse while still giving a carefree attitude, usually enjoying it at the same time. During a tetris collaboration with fellow Hololive member
Akai Haato
, she shared a story on how she accidentally killed a frog by squeezing it too hard and as such suffocated it in her hands when she was young. Another example would be that when she was playing
"Hitman"
, she used civilians to practice her aim

Anemachi
[
edit
]
Anemachi (姉街)
is Suisei's older sister who can sometimes be heard in the background of Suisei's streams, and both of them are seen to be very close to each other. Anemachi and Suisei voices are very similar, so much so that sometimes it's hard to tell who is talking when they are chatting. She is also a huge fan of the trading card game
"Cardfight!! Vanguard"
, to the point of encouraging Suisei to play the game to get her interested so that she would have someone to talk to about the game. The sisters are said to have terrible luck, though Suisei seems to have it worse. During Suisei's second 3D stream, she appeared as a surprise guest, complete with a design model that she drew herself.

Her model have clothes in a similar design to Suisei, though the stark contrast is her pink hair colour.
No speculations and rumors, just fun facts!
