Official Bio

"Hiya-peko! Hiya-peko! Hiya-pekooo! I'm Usada Pekora, peko!"
A lonely rabbit-eared girl who loves carrots. She loves them so much that she always brings a few anywhere she goes.
Overview
[
edit
]
A young and hip rabbit from Pekoland that appends "peko" at the end of her sentences. Part of the 3rd generation,
Hololive Fantasy
, she is eternally 111 years old (increments by 0.0000….1 every year). The conversion from Pekoland years to human years frequently changes depending on her mood. In the beginning, Pekora mentioned that when converted, it roughly equals late teens and early twenties; however, during her loli stream, she established that she was 3 years old (1 + 1 + 1 = 3 years old), and has continued to use that conversion method since.
[
13
]
Known for her chaotic personality and motormouth pace, she's quickly become one of the most well-known members of Hololive.
The carrots she has in her hair are raised in her family's farm. She wears them both as a fashion and snack. Although it is difficult to see, under the white dress is a bunny girl outfit. Not only is showing full body rare, she rarely shows full upper body, so seeing anything else is rare during the stream. Her scarf is a living being called Don-chan, which is always with her.
When she's upset, her right ear folds. When she plays horror games, it's permanently folded. Her ears are not detachable. According to Pekora, the reason why she has 4 ears (2 human, 2 rabbit) is because "humans like something resembling them, so to help me blend in, mom gave them to me." However, she gave one pair of her rabbit ears to
Kiryu Coco
on her birthday, claiming it'll grow back quickly. Additionally, her tail is hidden in the idol costume because she put it inside her spats.
Her representative emote is a pair of dancers in bunny suits (female).
Personality
[
edit
]
Pekora is known for being very chaotic and a prankster, someone who likes to play by her own rules. She has a unique verbal tic in which she ends her sentences with the "-peko" suffix. Her peculiar laughter has been coined by some of her fans as the "arrow laugh".
She is quick to react angrily when things don't go her way. She tends to run away when she faces a powerful foe in video games, then apologizes meekly until she finds an opening or when the situation changes favorably, after which she quickly starts talking down to them again.
She is shy in real life or when there is a large group of people, but on her own stream she likes to talk a lot even without breaks. Despite all of that she is very caring to her friends and fans.

(ぺこちゃん) - How Nousagis refer to Pekora when affectionately treating her like a cute girl/idol or patronizingly talking down to her as though she were a child. Some of her seniors like

(うーぺー) -
U
(sada)
Pe
(kora) is Pekora's default in-game username.
Osa
(長) [Boss/chief/leader] - How Nousagis respectfully refer to Pekora, especially in the context of her position as leader of the Nousagi Alliance or whenever Pekora appoints herself as a leader of a group during game streams, such as the Dodo Team from ARK, Pekomin from Pikmin, etc.
[
62
]
Shachou
(社長) [Company president/CEO] - How
Moona
and Nousagis refer to Pekora during her Minecraft streams or when she does anything construction/building related.
Kusagi
(くさぎ) [Damn shitty rabbit] - A combination of kuso (くそ) and usagi (うさぎ). Commonly used by Nousagis whenever Pekora does anything mischievous and bratty.
Hijou Shoku
(非常食) [Emergency food supply] - During her earlier debut days, Pekora was treated as an emergency food supply by fellow hololive members on account of her being a rabbit. Threats of boiling and cooking this well known prankster as punishment for her antics have persisted to this day.

(兎鍋) [Rabbit stew pot] - Used by
Miko
when she often threatens to turn Pekora into
this dish
, along with cooked rabbit meat.
Snack Usada
[
edit
]
Snack Usada (スナック兎田)
[
63
]
is a type of stream in which Pekora plays the role of the kind motherly bartender hostess who offers consultation and life advice to answer and alleviate wary Nousagis' questions, troubles, insecurities, etc. The "Snack" in "Snack Usada" refers to
snack bar restaurants
found in Japan. These are a kind of hostess bar, an alcohol-serving bar that employs female staff who are paid to serve male customers. During Snack Usada streams, Pekora-mama (ぺこらママ) is how Pekora herself and Nousagis refer to Pekora. Pekora's mother also made an appearance
[
64
]
on the show to try out some of Pekora's
Umeshu Plum Wine
.
Family Members
[
edit
]
Mommy (マミー)
[
edit
]
Out of all her family members, Pekora has talked about her mother the most. This is likely due to her having had the most daily interactions with her mother as Pekora tends to be holed up in her room. Her Mother made her on-stream debut in the legendary "coming out" stream on held on Dec. 13, 2020
[
65
]
. This was after Pekora had made a promise during a 600k karaoke stream, to bring her mother on-stream when she achieved a 1 million YouTube subscriber milestone
[
66
]
. Pekora has a very familiar and friendly casual relationship with her mom. PekoMama spoke with a calm and graceful voice (which Pekora insists is not how she normally talks) while also displaying a strong sense of humor and bantering with her daughter in front of an audience of over 120k live viewers. Her mother remains, to this day, the only family member who is aware of her VTuber related activities and actively watches her streams
[
67
]
. Christine was the nickname Pekora arbitrarily gave her mother in a tweet
[
68
]
. She has yet to use this name on-stream. Fans refer to her mother as PekoMama (ぺこママ). PekoMama is of Blood-type A and fond of Alcohol.
Papa (パパ)
[
edit
]
Pekora has mentioned her father's existence on more than one occasion but doesn't elaborate any further. He is of Blood-type A.
Michael (ミカエル/Mikhail)
[
edit
]
This is the nickname Pekora gave to her oldest brother during a member-only singing stream on June 20, 2020 and then publicly during the Getting Over It 50-clear gold pot endurance stream
[
69
]
. She further elaborated more on Michael during a Snack Usada stream
[
70
]
. By default, Michael is the brother she talks about most in her childhood stories some of which involve her stealing his milk, hanging out in his room and playing his games. He seemed to have been quite tolerant of her antics when they were kids.
Diablo (ディアボロ)
[
edit
]
This is the nickname Pekora gave to her 2nd older brother during the final stage of Crash Bandicoot 1
[
71
]
and elaborated further during a Snack Usada stream
[
72
]
. Pekora isn't as close to Diablo and rarely talks about him. He was far less tolerant of her antics when they were kids and by her own admission, her 'bratty' childhood behavior may have contributed to their chilly relationship.
Usada Construction
[
edit
]
Usada construction (兎田建設/兎建/Usada Kensetsu/UsaKen) of the Hololive Minecraft server (ホロ鯖/HoloSaba) is a company best known for bringing convenience to Hololive members and advancing the main Hololive Village (HoloMura) to the 'modern age' via automation. UsaKen originated in 2019
[
73
]
on the old hololive server back when Pekora built zombie traps and towers, however it didn't become widely recognized by fellow hololive members until Pekora built the monster trap farm, TTT, on the current server.
UsaKen was a solo "company-in-name-only" until Pekora recruited
Moona
to join the company in 2020. Since Moona took charge of the design side of the company's building operations, it's sometimes misunderstood that she is the president (Shachou/社長). She is currently the vice president (Fuku Shachou/副社長) and was formerly the director (Buchou/部長). Later on other members joined the company. The current list of members include
Moona Hoshinova
,
Kiryu Coco
,
Takanashi Kiara
,
Tokoyami Towa
,
Uruha Rushia
and part-timer/spy
Amane Kanata
.
Shishiro Botan
who runs her own company, Menya Botan, is a frequent collaborator and has worked on various projects with Usada construction.
Usada Construction's most iconic facility, the monster trap tower
[
74
]
[
75
]
better known as TTT, was initially built to farm gunpowder as fuel for her TNT Cannon and is now used to farm for experience, gunpowder, bones and various other materials. TTT is located within the hololive server (not resource server), but was placed so far from the main HoloMura that it initially required using Nether Portals to shorten the travel time. This was done in order to avoid causing significant lag to the server. A portal that was implemented in 2021 by a server administrator now allows instant access to the TTT area without going through Nether Portals. Some of UsaKen's various other projects include, a TNT Cannon
