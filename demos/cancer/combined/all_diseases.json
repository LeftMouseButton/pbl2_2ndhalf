      "summary": "Acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the vestibulocochlear nerve, which connects the ear to the brain. It typically grows slowly and can press against the hearing and balance nerves, leading to symptoms like hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, and balance problems. If it grows large enough, it can press against the brainstem and become life-threatening. It can also cause facial numbness or paralysis. In some cases, acoustic neuromas are associated with a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).",

At diagnosis, about 25% of cases have already spread to other parts of the body.

They are relatively difficult to detect and diagnose at an early stage due to nonspecific symptoms and histological characteristics. Common symptoms include bloating, abdominal distention, ascites, and dyspareunia. The exact cause is unknown, but genetic mutations and environmental factors are implicated. Treatment typically involves surgical resection coupled with chemotherapy.",

There are three main types: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC), and melanoma. BCC and SCC are collectively known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). BCC typically grows slowly and rarely spreads, while SCC is more likely to spread. Melanoma is the most aggressive and dangerous type. Diagnosis is usually made by biopsy and histopathological examination. Treatment depends on the type, location, and stage of the cancer, and commonly involves surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and biologic therapy.",

      "summary": "Wilms tumor is a rare type of kidney cancer that typically occurs in children, causing a tumor on one or both kidneys. It is the most common malignant renal tumor in children. While the majority of cases occur in children without associated genetic syndromes, a minority have congenital abnormalities. The tumor is highly responsive to treatment, with a high cure rate.",
