  "summary": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive and rare cancer originating in the cortex (outer part) of the adrenal gland, which produces vital hormones like sex hormones and cortisol. It often presents with various hormonal syndromes due to steroid hormone-producing tumors, and can invade nearby tissues or metastasize to distant organs. The disease has a bimodal age distribution, affecting children under 5 and adults between 30-60, with women more frequently affected. The overall 5-year survival rate is about 50%.",
