  "summary": "Mucinous tumors are a type of ovarian tumor, accounting for approximately 36% of all ovarian neoplasms. They are characterized by being filled with a mucus-like material produced by mucus-secreting goblet cells. Approximately 75% are benign, 10% are borderline, and 15% are malignant. They can become very large and may present bilaterally, though this is rare for primary tumors.",
