  "summary": "Hypopharyngeal cancer is a rare type of head and neck cancer where malignant cells grow in the hypopharynx, the area where the larynx and esophagus meet. It originates in the outer layer (epithelium) of the hypopharynx and progresses by spreading into deeper tissues. Due to its late-stage diagnosis and proximity to lymphatic vessels, it has a high mortality rate.",
