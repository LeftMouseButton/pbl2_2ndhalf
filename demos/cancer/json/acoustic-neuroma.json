  "summary": "Acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the vestibulocochlear nerve, which connects the ear to the brain. It typically grows slowly and can press against the hearing and balance nerves, leading to symptoms like hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, and balance problems. If it grows large enough, it can press against the brainstem and become life-threatening. It can also cause facial numbness or paralysis. In some cases, acoustic neuromas are associated with a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).",
  "causes": [
    "Malfunction of Schwann cells that form the insulating myelin sheath on the vestibulocochlear nerve",
    "Mutation in the tumor suppressor gene, NF2, located on chromosome 22, resulting in abnormal production of the cell protein Merlin"
