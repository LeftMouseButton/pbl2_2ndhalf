  "summary": "Head and neck cancer is a term for cancers that develop in the mouth, nose and sinuses, salivary glands, and throat and voice box (larynx). Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell cancers, beginning in the moist tissues lining the head and neck. The cancer cells can spread into deeper tissue as the cancer grows. Other cancers like brain cancer, eye cancer, and esophageal cancer are not typically considered head and neck cancers due to different treatments.",
