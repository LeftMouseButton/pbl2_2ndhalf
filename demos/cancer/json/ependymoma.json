  "disease_name": "Ependymoma",
  "synonyms": [],
  "summary": "Ependymoma is a tumor originating from the ependyma, a tissue of the central nervous system that lines the brain's ventricles and the spinal cord's central canal. It is a common type of childhood brain and spinal cord tumor, accounting for up to 10% of pediatric CNS tumors and 5% of adult intracranial gliomas. While typically intracranial in children and spinal in adults, it can rarely occur in the pelvic cavity. Ependymomas can be benign or malignant, with incidence peaking around age 5 and again at age 35.",
