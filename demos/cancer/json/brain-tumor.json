  "summary": "A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain tissues, which can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). They are classified as primary (originating in the brain) or secondary (metastatic, spreading from other parts of the body). Symptoms vary based on tumor size and location, and can include headaches, seizures, and cognitive changes.",
