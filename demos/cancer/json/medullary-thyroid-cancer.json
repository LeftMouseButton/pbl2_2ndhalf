  "summary": "Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a form of thyroid cancer that originates from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland, which produce the hormone calcitonin. It is the third most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for about 3% of all cases. MTC can occur sporadically or be hereditary, often associated with genetic mutations in the RET proto-oncogene.",
  "causes": [
    "Mutation in the RET proto-oncogene (sporadic and hereditary)",
    "Hereditary genetic disorder (familial medullary thyroid cancer)",
    "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2A and MEN2B)"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Age between 25 and 65",
    "Being female",
    "Being Asian",
    "Exposure to certain types of radiation (head or neck radiation treatment as a child, radiation emergency)",
