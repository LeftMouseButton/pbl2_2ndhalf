  "summary": "Myelofibrosis is a rare bone marrow blood cancer classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm. It involves the remodeling of bone marrow with osteosclerosis and the secretion of collagen and reticulin proteins (fibrosis), which compromise normal bone marrow function and lead to decreased production of blood cells like erythrocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. It can also be a complication of other myeloproliferative disorders like polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.",
