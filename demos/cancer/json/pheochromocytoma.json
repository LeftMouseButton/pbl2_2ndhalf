  "summary": "Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that usually starts in the cells of one of your adrenal glands. Although they are usually benign, pheochromocytomas often cause the adrenal gland to make too many hormones, leading to high blood pressure and symptoms such as headaches, sweating, pounding of the heart, shakiness, and paleness. It is part of the paraganglioma (PGL) family of neuroendocrine tumors. These tumors can release catecholamines into the bloodstream, causing symptoms like hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, and headaches. Pheochromocytoma is sometimes part of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN).",
