  "summary": "Eye cancer is a rare disease that can affect all parts of the eye. It can be primary, starting within the eye (e.g., intraocular melanoma, lymphoma, retinoblastoma), or metastatic, spreading to the eye from other primary cancers (e.g., breast, lung). Eye cancers can be malignant or benign, with malignant forms often referred to as eye cancer. Treatment varies by type and advancement, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",
