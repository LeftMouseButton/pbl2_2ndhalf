  "summary": "Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, is a rare type of cancer that forms in the bile ducts, which are tubes that carry digestive bile from the liver to the small intestine. It can occur inside or outside the liver, with extrahepatic forms being more common. The disease is typically an adenocarcinoma and often presents as incurable at diagnosis, making early detection crucial. It is rare in the Western world but has higher rates in Southeast Asia, often linked to parasitic infections. Symptoms include jaundice, abdominal pain, and weight loss, while diagnosis involves imaging, blood tests, and biopsy. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies.",
