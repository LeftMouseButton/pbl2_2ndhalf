  "summary": "Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is a malignant tumor of the stomach that develops in the lining of the stomach due to abnormal cell growth. It is often diagnosed late due to non-specific early symptoms, leading to a generally poor prognosis. The cancer can spread to other parts of the body, including the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen, and lymph nodes. Globally, it is a significant cause of cancer-related deaths.",
