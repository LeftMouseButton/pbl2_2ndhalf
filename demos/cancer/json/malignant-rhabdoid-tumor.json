  "summary": "Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor (MRT) is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that typically affects infants and young children. It is characterized by the presence of large, atypical cells with rhabdoid features. MRT can occur in various parts of the body, most commonly in the kidney (nephroblastoma), brain (medulloblastoma), and soft tissues. The exact cause is not fully understood, but genetic mutations, particularly in the SMARCB1 gene, are strongly associated with its development. Due to its aggressive nature, MRT often has a poor prognosis, and treatment usually involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.",
