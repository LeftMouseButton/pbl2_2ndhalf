  "summary": "Endometrial cancer is the most common type of uterine cancer, originating in the endometrium (lining of the uterus). It is characterized by abnormal cell growth that can invade or spread, often presenting with abnormal vaginal bleeding, particularly after menopause. While the exact cause is unknown, genetic abnormalities and factors altering hormone balance are significant contributors to its development.",
