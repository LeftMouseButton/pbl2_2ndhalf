  "summary": "Fallopian tube cancer is a malignant neoplasm that originates from the fallopian tube. It is grouped under epithelial ovarian cancers and shares similarities and treatments with ovarian and primary peritoneal cancers. It occurs when there are genetic mutations in the DNA, often of unknown cause, but can also be inherited. The cancer forms in the tissues lining a fallopian tube, which are part of the female reproductive system.",
