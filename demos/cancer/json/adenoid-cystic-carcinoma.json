  "summary": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare type of cancer that can occur in various body sites, most commonly in the salivary glands. It is the third-most common malignant salivary gland tumor overall and the most common malignant salivary gland tumor in the submandibular gland region. ACC is generally well-differentiated and slow-growing, allowing patients to survive for years with metastases, though late-occurring metastatic disease can lead to death.",
  "causes": [
    "Activation of the MYB oncogene",
    "MYB gene fusion with the NFIB gene due to t(6;9) translocation",
    "MYB activation by copy number gain",
    "MYB activation by juxtaposition of enhancer elements near the MYB gene",
    "Fusion of the MYBL1 gene to NFIB or other partners"
