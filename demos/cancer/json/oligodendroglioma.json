  "summary": "Oligodendrogliomas are a type of glioma believed to originate from oligodendrocytes or glial precursor cells. They primarily occur in adults but are also found in children, comprising about 5% of all central nervous system tumors. They are characterized by a high rate of recurrence and a tendency to increase in grade over time.",
