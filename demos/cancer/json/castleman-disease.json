  "summary": "Castleman disease is a group of rare lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by enlarged lymph nodes and a broad range of inflammatory symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. It involves the overproduction of cytokines and other inflammatory proteins by the body's immune system, and distinct abnormal lymph node features. The disease affects the lymphatic system, which is crucial for fighting infection and maintaining fluid balance.",
