  "summary": "Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin, occurring when skin cells grow uncontrollably and form malignant tumors. They are the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in humans, with the primary cause being prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.",
  "causes": [
    "Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning devices",
    "UVB radiation via direct DNA damage (for BCC and SCC)",
    "UVA radiation via indirect DNA damage (for melanoma)",
    "HPV infections (for squamous-cell skin cancer)",
    "Genetic syndromes (e.g., congenital melanocytic nevi syndrome)",
    "Chronic non-healing wounds (Marjolin's ulcers)",
    "Ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays)",
    "Environmental carcinogens",
    "Artificial UV radiation (tanning beds)",
    "Alcohol consumption (excessive drinking)",
    "Use of immunosuppressive medications (e.g., Cyclosporin A, azathioprine)",
    "Deliberate exposure of sensitive skin to sunlight"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation",
    "Sun tanning beds",
    "Childhood exposure to UV radiation (for melanomas and basal-cell cancers)",
    "Total UV exposure (for squamous-cell skin cancers)",
    "Having moles (20-30% of melanomas develop from moles)",
    "Lighter skin color",
    "Poor immune function (e.g., from medications or HIV/AIDS)",

    "Crusting and bleeding in the center of the tumor (BCC)",
    "Sore that does not heal (BCC)",
    "Red, scaling, thickened patch on sun-exposed skin (SCC)",
    "Firm hard nodules with a scaly top (SCC)",
    "Ulceration and bleeding (SCC)",

    "Change in the size, shape, color, or elevation of a mole (melanoma)",
    "Appearance of a new mole during adulthood (melanoma)",
    "Pain, itching, ulceration, redness around the site, or bleeding at the site (melanoma)",
