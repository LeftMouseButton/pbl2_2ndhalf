  "synonyms": [],
  "summary": "Clear cell sarcoma is a rare subtype of cancer, specifically a sarcoma, primarily affecting soft tissues and the dermis. It is characterized by the expression of specific fusion genes, most commonly EWSR1-ATF1. Recurrence is common, and metastasis occurs in over 50% of cases, often to bone, lymph nodes, and lungs.",
