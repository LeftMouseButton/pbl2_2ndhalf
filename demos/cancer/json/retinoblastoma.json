  "summary": "Retinoblastoma is a rare and aggressive cancer that develops from immature cells in the retina, the light-detecting tissue of the eye. It is the most common primary malignant intraocular cancer in children, with the majority of cases detected in children under three years old. While survival rates are high in developed countries, affected children may experience vision loss or require eye removal. The disease can be hereditary, linked to genetic defects, or sporadic, caused by congenital mutations.",
