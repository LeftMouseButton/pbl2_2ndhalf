  "summary": "Mesothelioma is a rare but serious cancer of the mesothelium, the tissue lining internal organs such as the lungs, heart, and abdomen. It most commonly starts in the lungs and is strongly linked to asbestos exposure, with a long latency period between exposure and disease onset. Symptoms can include breathing difficulties, cough, chest or abdominal pain, and weight loss. Diagnosis often involves imaging tests and biopsy, and treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.",
