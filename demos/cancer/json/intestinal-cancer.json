  "summary": "Colorectal cancer is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum. It is the consequence of uncontrolled growth of colon cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Globally, it is the third-most common type of cancer.",
