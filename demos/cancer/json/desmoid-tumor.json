  "summary": "Desmoid tumor, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, is a rare, locally aggressive and invasive type of fibromatosis related to sarcoma. It arises from fibroblasts and does not metastasize, but can cause pain, loss of function, and life-threatening problems by compressing vital organs. Most cases are sporadic, but some are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The condition is characterized by a variable and often unpredictable clinical course, with a tendency for recurrence.",
