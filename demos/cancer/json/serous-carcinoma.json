  "summary": "Serous tumors are neoplasms that typically have papillary to solid formations of tumor cells with crowded nuclei. They commonly arise on the modified Müllerian-derived serous membranes that surround the ovaries in females, accounting for approximately a quarter of all ovarian tumors. Rarely, serous tumors can arise from within the uterus (uterine serous carcinoma), other parts of the peritoneum, or even in locations like the lungs.",
  "causes": [
    "Unknown for uterine serous carcinoma, but it is classified as a type II endometrial cancer and does not develop from endometrial hyperplasia or is hormone-sensitive.",
    "Originating from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube has emerged as an origin for many high-grade serous carcinomas."
