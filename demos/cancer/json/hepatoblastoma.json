  "summary": "Hepatoblastoma is a malignant liver cancer occurring in infants and children, composed of tissue resembling fetal liver cells, mature liver cells, or bile duct cells. It is typically unifocal, affects the right lobe of the liver more often than the left lobe, and can metastasize. It is most commonly diagnosed during a child's first three years of life.",
