  "summary": "Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a cancer of the white blood cells, specifically a type of chronic leukemia. It is characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and their accumulation in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome, which creates the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This gene produces an abnormal protein that causes leukemia cells to grow out of control, crowding out healthy blood cells and leading to infection, anemia, and bleeding.",
