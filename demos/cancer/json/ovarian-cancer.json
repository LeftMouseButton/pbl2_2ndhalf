  ],
  "summary": "Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor that forms in the tissues of an ovary. It can originate from the ovary itself or from nearby structures like the fallopian tubes or the lining of the abdomen. The most common type is epithelial ovarian cancer, which begins in the cells covering the ovary. Other rarer types include malignant germ cell tumors and stromal tumors. Ovarian cancer often lacks early symptoms, and by the time symptoms appear, the cancer is frequently advanced.",
