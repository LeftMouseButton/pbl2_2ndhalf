  "synonyms": [
    "CLL"

  "summary": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a chronic blood cancer originating in the bone marrow, characterized by the overproduction of abnormal lymphocytes. These abnormal cells displace healthy blood cells, leading to symptoms such as infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. It primarily affects adults, especially those over 50, and can spread to other body parts.",
  "causes": [
    "Genetic changes in bone marrow cells",
