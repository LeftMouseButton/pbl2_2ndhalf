  "summary": "Skin cancer is a type of cancer that arises from the skin cells, characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. It is the most common form of cancer globally. The primary cause is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning devices, which damages skin cell DNA. There are three main types: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC), and melanoma. BCC and SCC are collectively known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). BCC typically grows slowly and rarely spreads, while SCC is more likely to spread. Melanoma is the most aggressive and dangerous type. Diagnosis is usually made by biopsy and histopathological examination. Treatment depends on the type, location, and stage of the cancer, and commonly involves surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and biologic therapy.",
