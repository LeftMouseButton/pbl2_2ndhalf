  "synonyms": [

  "summary": "Leukemia is a group of blood cancers that start in the bone marrow and produce large numbers of abnormal blood cells, most often white blood cells. These abnormal cells crowd out healthy blood cells, impairing their function. Leukemia can be classified by the type of blood cell affected (lymphocytes or myeloid cells) and its growth rate (acute or chronic).",
