  "summary": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of cancers in which blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature properly and therefore do not develop into healthy blood cells. Early on, no symptoms are typically seen. Later, symptoms may include fatigue, shortness of breath, bleeding disorders, anemia, or frequent infections. Some types may develop into acute myeloid leukemia.",
