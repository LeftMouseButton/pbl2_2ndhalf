  "summary": "Male breast cancer (MBC) is a cancer that originates in the breasts of males. It is much less common than breast cancer in females, accounting for less than 1% of new breast cancer cases worldwide. While many treatment strategies are adopted from female breast cancer, MBC can have distinct presentations, associations, and genetic factors.",
  "causes": [
    "Genetic mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, PTEN, ATM, RAD51L3)",
    "Tumor protein P53 gene mutations (associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome)",
    "DNA mismatch repair gene mutations (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EpCAM) (associated with Lynch syndrome)",
    "PTEN gene mutations (associated with Cowden syndrome)"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Age (most often between 60 and 70)",
