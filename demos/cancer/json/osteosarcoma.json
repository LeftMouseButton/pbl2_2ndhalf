  "summary": "Osteosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin and exhibits osteoblastic differentiation, producing malignant osteoid. It is the most common histological form of primary bone sarcoma and is most prevalent in teenagers and young adults. It can also occur in other animals, including dogs, cats, and dinosaurs.",
