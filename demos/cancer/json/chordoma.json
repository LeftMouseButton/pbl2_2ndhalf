  "summary": "Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing cancer (neoplasm) that arises from cellular remnants of the notochord in the bones of the skull base and spine. It is classified as a type of bone cancer and sarcoma, often mistakenly referred to as brain, brainstem, or spinal cord tumors due to its location near critical nervous structures.",
