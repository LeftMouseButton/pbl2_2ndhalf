  ],
  "summary": "Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing neuroendocrine cancers primarily originating in the digestive tract or lungs. They are often asymptomatic in early stages, but can produce hormones, notably serotonin, leading to carcinoid syndrome, characterized by flushing, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties. They have malignant potential and can metastasize.",
