  "summary": "Primary peritoneal cancer (PPC) is a cancer of the cells lining the peritoneum, or abdominal cavity. It is histomorphologically and molecular biologically similar to serous carcinomas, including ovarian serous carcinoma, and is often considered one entity with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and uterine serous carcinoma. It usually affects women and is diagnosed after the age of 60.",
