  "disease_name": "Breast Cancer",
  "synonyms": [],
  "summary": "Breast cancer is a cancer that starts in breast tissue when cells in the breast change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor. It can be 'in situ' (not spread) or 'invasive' (spread to nearby tissues, lymph nodes, or metastasize to other parts of the body). It is the most common invasive cancer in women globally and the second most common type of cancer in women in the United States, though it can also affect men.",
