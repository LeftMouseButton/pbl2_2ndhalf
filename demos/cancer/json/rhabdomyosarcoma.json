  "summary": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly aggressive form of cancer that develops from mesenchymal cells that have failed to fully differentiate into myocytes of skeletal muscle. It is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children and the third most common solid tumor in children. RMS can occur in any soft-tissue site but is primarily found in the head, neck, orbit, genitourinary tract, genitals, and extremities. Prognosis is closely tied to the location of the primary tumor and the subtype.",
