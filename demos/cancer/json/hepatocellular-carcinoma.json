  "summary": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. It most commonly occurs in individuals with chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis or fibrosis, often stemming from chronic liver injury and inflammation. HCC is rare in those without chronic liver disease. The incidence is increasing in higher-income countries due to rising rates of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatitis C virus infections. It is more common in males than females.",
