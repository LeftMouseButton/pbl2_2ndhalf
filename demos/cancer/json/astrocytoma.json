  "summary": "Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor originating from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes, primarily in the cerebrum, and occasionally in the spinal cord. It is the second most common glioma and typically does not spread outside the central nervous system. Astrocytomas are graded from I to IV based on malignancy, with low-grade types often found in children and young adults, and high-grade types more prevalent in adults.",
