  "summary": "Ewing sarcoma is a rare pediatric cancer that forms in bone or soft tissue, most commonly in the legs, pelvis, and chest wall. It primarily affects children, teenagers, and young adults, with a peak incidence between 10 and 20 years of age. It is the second most common bone cancer in children and adolescents. The disease is often characterized by a genetic translocation, most frequently between chromosomes 11 and 22, leading to an EWS-FLI1 fusion protein. At diagnosis, about 25% of cases have already spread to other parts of the body. Treatment typically involves a multidisciplinary approach including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, with a 5-year survival rate of over 70% for localized disease.",
