  "summary": "Stomach cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in the lining of the stomach due to abnormal cell growth. It most commonly affects older individuals and can spread to other parts of the body. Early diagnosis is challenging due to non-specific symptoms, often leading to advanced disease at presentation. The prognosis is generally poor, especially for advanced cases.",
