  "summary": "Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland at the base of the brain that acts as the 'master control gland' by producing hormones affecting growth and other glands. Most pituitary tumors are benign and often asymptomatic. However, hormone-producing tumors can disrupt hormonal balance, leading to endocrine diseases like Cushing's syndrome and hyperthyroidism. Symptoms can include headaches, vision problems, nausea, vomiting, and issues related to hormone overproduction or underproduction. Treatment options include surgery, medication, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.",
