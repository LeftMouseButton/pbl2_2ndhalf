  "synonyms": [

  "summary": "Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that forms in nerve cells called neuroblasts. It usually begins in the adrenal glands but can also start in the neck, chest, or spinal cord. Neuroblasts are immature nerve tissue that normally develop into working nerve cells, but in neuroblastoma, they form a tumor. It is the most common cancer in babies and the third-most common cancer in children.",
