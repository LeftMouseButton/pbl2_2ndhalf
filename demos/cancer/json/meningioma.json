  "summary": "Meningioma is a typically slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges, the membranous layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms depend on the location and occur as a result of the tumor pressing on nearby tissue. Many cases never produce symptoms. They are usually benign but can be atypical or malignant. Meningiomas are extra-axial and vascularized.",
