  "disease_name": "Angiosarcoma",
  "synonyms": [],
  "summary": "Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive cancer originating in the endothelial cells that line blood or lymphatic vessels. It can appear anywhere in the body, but is most commonly found in older individuals and frequently affects the skin, particularly the scalp. The disease often presents with non-specific symptoms or can be asymptomatic, and multiple-organ involvement is common at the time of diagnosis. It is known for its high metastatic potential and poor prognosis.",
  "causes": [
    "Damage to the DNA of endothelial cells, leading to uncontrolled cell division and inhibited programmed cell death (underlying causes of DNA damage are not fully understood)"
