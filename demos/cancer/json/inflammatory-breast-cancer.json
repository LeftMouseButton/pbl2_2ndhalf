  "summary": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer where cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast, causing the breast to become warm, red, and swollen. It often presents with symptoms resembling skin inflammation, such as redness and swelling, and may not be detected by mammography or ultrasound. IBC is characterized by rapid onset of symptoms and is often diagnosed at a later stage.",
