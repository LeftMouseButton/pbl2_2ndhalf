  "summary": "Multiple myeloma is a cancer that begins in plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that normally produces antibodies. These cells are part of the immune system. In time, myeloma cells collect in the bone marrow and in the solid parts of bones. As it progresses, bone pain, anemia, renal insufficiency, and infections may occur. Complications may include hypercalcemia and amyloidosis.",
