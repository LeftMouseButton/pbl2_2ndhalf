  "summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. They most commonly occur in the intestine, pancreas, or lungs. NETs can be slow-growing or aggressive and may produce hormones that cause various syndromes. Diagnosis involves imaging, blood markers, and histopathology. Treatment depends on the tumor's characteristics and may include surgery, somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy, or radionuclide therapy.",
