  "summary": "Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a group of pregnancy-related tumors that occur when cells in the womb start to proliferate uncontrollably. These cells, called trophoblasts, normally grow to form the placenta. GTD can be benign or malignant, with hydatidiform mole being the most common type. It can simulate pregnancy and produces chorionic gonadotropin. GTD primarily affects women of child-bearing age but can rarely occur in postmenopausal women.",
  "causes": [
    "Abnormal conception with excessive placental development",
    "Fertilized egg implants into the uterus, but chorionic villi do not develop properly",
    "Maternal ovum with no functional DNA (complete hydatidiform mole)",
    "Dispermic fertilization of an empty ovum (complete hydatidiform mole)",
    "Dispermic fertilization of a normal ovum (partial hydatidiform mole)"
