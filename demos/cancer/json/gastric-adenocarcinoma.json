  "summary": "Gastric cancer is a malignant tumor of the stomach that develops in the lining of the stomach due to abnormal cell growth. Most cases are gastric carcinomas, with subtypes including gastric adenocarcinomas. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors can also occur in the stomach. The cancer can spread to other parts of the body, including the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen, and lymph nodes. It is the fifth-leading type of cancer globally and the third-leading cause of cancer death.",
