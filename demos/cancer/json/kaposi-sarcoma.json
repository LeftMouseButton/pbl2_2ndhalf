  "summary": "Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that causes lesions (abnormal tissue) to grow in different parts of the body, including the skin, lymph nodes, mucous membranes, and other organs. These lesions are usually red or purple and are made of cancer cells, new blood vessels, and blood cells. KS can occur in multiple places simultaneously and is caused by infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), in individuals with weakened immune systems.",
