  "summary": "Medulloblastoma is a common type of primary malignant brain cancer in children that originates in the cerebellum or posterior fossa. It is an invasive, rapidly growing tumor that can spread through cerebrospinal fluid and metastasize to other parts of the brain and spinal cord. Historically classified as a PNET, it is now recognized as distinct from supratentorial PNETs.",
