  "summary": "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, locally aggressive malignant soft-tissue sarcoma originating in the dermis. It typically presents as a slow-growing, firm skin lesion resembling a bruise or pimple, often on the torso. While metastasis is rare, local recurrence is common if not completely excised.",
  "causes": [
    "Chromosomal translocation t(17;22) fusing COL1A1 and PDGF genes, leading to a self-stimulatory growth signal"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Exposure to certain chemicals (general for soft tissue sarcomas)",
    "Prior radiation therapy (general for soft tissue sarcomas)",
    "Certain genetic diseases (general for soft tissue sarcomas)",
    "Pregnancy (may accelerate tumor growth due to progesterone receptor expression)"
  ],
  "symptoms": [
    "Minor firm area of skin (1-5 cm in diameter)",
    "Lump or swelling in soft tissue",
    "Resembles a bruise, birthmark, or pimple",
    "Slow-growing tumor",
    "Protuberance (bump) (often delayed)",
    "Pain (if spread and pressing on nerves/organs)",
    "Trouble breathing (if spread and pressing on organs)"
  ],
  "diagnosis": [
    "Biopsy (core needle or surgical incision)",
    "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (for assessing depth of invasion)",
    "Immunohistochemical staining (e.g., for CD34, S-100 protein, hormone receptors)"
  ],
  "treatments": [
    "Surgery",
    "Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS)",
    "Wide local excision (WLE)",
    "Radiation therapy (RT) (if clear resection margins not achieved or for advanced disease)",
    "Chemotherapy (if clear resection margins not achieved or for advanced disease)",
    "Imatinib mesylate (tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic DFSP)"
