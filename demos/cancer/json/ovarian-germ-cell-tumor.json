  "summary": "Ovarian germ cell tumors (OGCTs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors derived from primitive germ cells of the embryonic gonad, accounting for about 2.6% of all ovarian malignancies. They are relatively difficult to detect and diagnose at an early stage due to nonspecific symptoms and histological characteristics. Common symptoms include bloating, abdominal distention, ascites, and dyspareunia. The exact cause is unknown, but genetic mutations and environmental factors are implicated. Treatment typically involves surgical resection coupled with chemotherapy.",
