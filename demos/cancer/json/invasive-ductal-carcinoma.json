  "summary": "Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding breast tissue. It is the most common type of invasive breast cancer, accounting for a significant majority of diagnoses in women and also occurring in men. It is characterized by cells that have invaded beyond the duct walls but lack specific differentiating features of other invasive breast cancer types, making it a diagnosis of exclusion. The disease can spread to nearby lymph nodes or metastasize to distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Prognosis varies based on factors like tumor grade, stage, and receptor status.",
