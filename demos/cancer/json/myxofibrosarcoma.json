  "summary": "Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma, often developing in elderly individuals. It is characterized by its tendency to recur locally after surgical resection, with recurrences often progressing to higher grades, metastasizing, and becoming life-threatening. An epithelioid variant is particularly aggressive.",
