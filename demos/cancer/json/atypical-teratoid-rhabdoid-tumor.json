  ],
  "summary": "Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor (AT/RT) is a rare, aggressive, Grade IV cancerous tumor primarily affecting the central nervous system (CNS) in infants and young children. It commonly occurs in the brain, especially the posterior cranial fossa, but can also be found in the spinal cord. AT/RT is characterized by specific genetic mutations, particularly deletions or mutations in the INI1/hSNF5 gene, and has a historically poor prognosis, though multimodal therapy has shown improved survival rates.",
