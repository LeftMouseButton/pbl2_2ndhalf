  "summary": "Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and common type of primary brain cancer, originating from astrocytes. It is characterized by rapid growth, infiltrative nature, and a poor prognosis. Diagnosis is typically made through imaging (CT, MRI) and tissue biopsy, often with molecular characterization. Treatment involves a multimodal approach including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, with temozolomide being a common chemotherapeutic agent. Despite treatment, recurrence is frequent.",
  "causes": [
    "Unknown for most cases",
    "Ionizing radiation exposure (including CT scan radiation)",
    "Hereditary syndromes (e.g., neurofibromatosis, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Turcot syndrome)",
