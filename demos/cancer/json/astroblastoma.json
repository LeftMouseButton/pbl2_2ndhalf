  "disease_name": "Astroblastoma",
  "synonyms": [],
  "summary": "Astroblastoma is a rare glial tumor derived from astroblasts, primarily found in the supratentorial region of the brain but can occur in other brain areas like the cerebellum, optic nerve, cauda equina, hypothalamus, and brain stem. It accounts for a small percentage of brain gliomas and is considered challenging to diagnose and treat among nervous system cancers.",
