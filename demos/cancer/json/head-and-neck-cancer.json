  "summary": "Head and neck cancer is a general term for cancers that develop in the mouth, nose and sinuses, salivary glands, and throat and voice box (larynx). Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell cancers, which begin in the moist tissues lining the head and neck. The cancer cells may spread into deeper tissue as the cancer grows. Other cancers, such as brain cancer, eye cancer, and esophageal cancer, can occur in the head and neck but are usually not considered head and neck cancers due to different treatments.",
