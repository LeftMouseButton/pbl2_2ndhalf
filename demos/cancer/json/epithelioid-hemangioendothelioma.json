  "summary": "Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma and vascular cancer, characterized by a distinct genetic alteration, often a fusion gene involving TAZ/WWTR1 and CAMTA1. It is considered intermediate between angiosarcoma and hemangioma, affecting endothelial cells and commonly found in veins of extremities, liver, lungs, bones, and skin. It typically has an indolent course but can present as an aggressive, high-grade tumor.",
