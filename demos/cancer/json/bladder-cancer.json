  "summary": "Bladder cancer is an abnormal growth of cells in the lining of the bladder, a hollow organ in the lower abdomen that stores urine. These cells can form a tumor that may spread and damage the bladder and other organs. It is the sixth most common type of cancer in the United States and the tenth most commonly diagnosed cancer globally.",
