  "summary": "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer that typically arises on sun-exposed areas of the body. It is characterized by firm, flesh-colored, red, or blue tumors that can enlarge rapidly. MCC can spread to lymph nodes and other organs. Its development is linked to the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), weakened immune systems, and ultraviolet radiation exposure.",
