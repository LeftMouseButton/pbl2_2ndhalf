  "summary": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, aggressive form of thyroid cancer characterized by uncontrolled growth of highly abnormal cells in the thyroid gland. It accounts for a small percentage of thyroid cancer cases but is responsible for a significant proportion of deaths due to its aggressive behavior, rapid growth, and resistance to many standard cancer treatments. ATC typically carries a very poor prognosis, with a median survival time of three to six months after diagnosis. It often presents as a rapidly enlarging neck mass and can cause symptoms by compressing local structures.",
