  "summary": "Bone cancer is an abnormal growth of tissue in bone, which can be benign or malignant. Malignant bone tumors can originate in the bone (primary) or spread from other parts of the body (secondary), with secondary tumors being significantly more common. Primary bone cancers include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma.",

    "Inflammation (for primary tumors)",
    "Metastasis from other cancers (e.g., Lung cancer, Breast cancer, Thyroid cancer, Kidney cancer, Prostate cancer)"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Age (10-19 years for Osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma)",
