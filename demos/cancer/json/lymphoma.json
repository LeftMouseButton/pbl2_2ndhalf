  "summary": "Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymph system, a part of the immune system. It develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. There are many types, broadly categorized into Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas arise when T cells or B cells become abnormal and divide uncontrollably, potentially spreading throughout the body. Lymphomas are a part of the broader group of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.",
